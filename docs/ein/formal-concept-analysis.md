# Formal concept analysis

Formal concept analysis (FCA) is a principled way of
deriving a concept hierarchy or formal ontology
from a collection of objects and their properties.

Each concept in the hierarchy
represents the objects sharing some set of properties;
and each sub-concept in the hierarchy
represents a subset of the objects
(as well as a superset of the properties)
in the concepts above it.

Formal concept analysis can be used as
an unsupervised machine learning technique
that applies mathematical lattice theory
to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes.

Data tables can be transformed into algebraic structures
called complete lattices, and that these can be utilized
for data visualization and interpretation.

Formal concept analysis works on the binary relation:
"object has attribute",
which makes one think of general binary relational algebra.
