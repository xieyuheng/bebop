- a dynamic knowledge base implemented by propagator model,
  if you improve part of the knowledge base,
  the improvement will propagate over the whole knowledge base.

- a partial function of type A -> B
  can be improved by join the partial function with another partial function.

- if you have 10 partial solutions to solve A -> B.
  you can get better solution by join these partial solutions,
  and you can evolve this better solution
  by removing not so good parts and adding better parts,
  while keep the solution functioning.

- when an expert try to understand a network of knowledge,
  he propagate local knowledge through the network.

  when an expert try to solve a network of problems,
  he propagate local solution through the network.

- the propagator idea
  independent stateless machines
  connecting stateful cells

  and we put information about value in the cells
  and improve the information

- how about function of type A -> A
  if we have a propagator network of type A -> A
  we will have a knowledge base
  which can filling details about information of type A
